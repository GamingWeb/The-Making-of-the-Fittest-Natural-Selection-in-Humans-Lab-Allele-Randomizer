# What is this?
This is a randomizer for the "Making of the Fittest Natural Selection in Humans" lab given in some High School Honors Biology Courses.

# Features
 - Set size of parent allele groups
 - Put weights on either allele (or both)
 - Use COLORS (helps you take down notes in your lab notebook/sheet)
 - Does percentage calculations in the background, and presents them to you in the third page of the GUI
 - Allows for multiple scenarios (has a reset button)

# Requirements
 - Python 3.7
 - Tkinter
 
I hope this helps!
